# BookBot

BookBot is a simple CLI app I built while taking Boot.dev's backend courses. It analyzes a `.txt` file and outputs the total word count and the frequency of each character.

## How to run

1. Make sure you have a `.txt` file in the `books/` folder
2. Run the app using your terminal. Example for Python3: `python3 main.py books/frankenstein.txt`
